# GitHub Activity CLI
This is a solution to the [GitHub User Activity ](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity) from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh). It is a program used to fetch the recent activity of a GitHub user and display it in the terminal. This project allowed me to work on my backend development skills including working with APIs, handling JSON data, and building a simple CLI application.

## How to run this program
Clone this repository and run the application in the terminal with the desired username.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MalachyKitson/github-activity-cli.git
python github-activity-cli.py <username>
```
